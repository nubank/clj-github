  "Runs a sequence of flows mocking calls to github api. Behavior of the mock
  can be setup via the following attributes:

  - `:initial-state`: a map containing information about organizations
  and repositories that will form the initial state of the emulator.

  Example:
  ```
  {:orgs [{:name \"nubank\" :repos [{:name \"some-repo\" :default_branch \"master\"}]}]}
  ```

  `default_branch` is optional and will default to \"main\".

  - `:responses`: allow mocking specific calls that are not supported out of the box.
  Responses are a vector of request and response pairs.

  Example:

  ```
  [\"/repos/nubank/some-repo/pulls/1\" {:status 200 :body {:id 1}}]
  ```

  This is backed up by `http-kit-fake`, for more details on how to declare requests and responses
  see https://github.com/d11wtq/http-kit-fake."
